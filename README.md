## Open Source apps

### Count The Days Left

A SwiftUI iOS/WatchOS app written as learning project - see [my blog](https://writingontablets.com/categories#Count%20The%20Days%20Left) for more details

The code is all open source, and in [this repo](https://github.com/bravelocation/daysleft).

### Yeltzland 

I've been developing websites and apps to help support my local football team [Halesowen Town](https://ht-fc.co.uk) for more years than I care to remember!

There are iOS, watchOS, tvOS and Android apps, as well as Alexa and Google voice assistant skills.

The code was open source, but as they are constantly in development I didn't want potential clients reviewing the code as they may not always be in a perfect state.

However, if you'd like access to the code - particularly if you'd like to help on the development - please let me know at [johnp@bravelocation.com](mailto:johnp@bravelocation.com) as I'd be happy to help you out!
